Ymmersion Final Project - Connect Four Challenge in Go

I/ Grid creation

The grid will be represented as a bi-dimensional 7x7 array, every sub-array will represent a column (a schematic in
the README.md should help to understand).

II/ Player interaction

The program will interact with players by asking inputs (integers) in the console to select a column.
Input errors (input != int, input < 1 or > 7) will be handled and clearly explained to players.
Grid errors (column full, grid full) will also be explained to players.

III/ Project organization

The main.go file is only going to import every dependencies, create the grid, and announce the end of the game.
Every others functions required to make the game works properly will be split in several files organized by
categories (grid & players) and used in the main to end the game properly.
